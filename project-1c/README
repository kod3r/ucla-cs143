Phil Crumm
Ivan Petkov

We implemented all portions of the specification for this project such as adding new actor/director information, adding new movie information, adding comments and ratings to movies, crediting actors and directors for their roles in movies (e.g. adding a relation between people and movies), as well as viewing actor/director/movie information, and of course searching the database.

	* implemented a page to add new actor and director information
	* implemented a page for viewing actor/director information, including any movies they have starred in or directed
	* implemented a page for viewing movie information, including submitted comments and ratings
	* implemented a page for submitting new movie reviews and comments
