## Projects

Note: since this class focuses on databases and *not* on web applications. Since the project specifications explicitly state to expect valid, nonexploitive inputs, their sanitization is nonexhaustive or missing altogether in the face of time constraints.

### Project 1A
Simple PHP "calculator" -- an exercise in PHP

### Project 1B
Precursor to a movie database -- an exercise in establishing SQL constraints

### Project 1C
A web interface for an actual movie database

### Project 2
A simple SQL database which can load data from a CSV, and select on it for given constraints.

* SQL parsing and disk IO modules provided by the instructor.
* Indexing, data loading, and data selection implemented by Ivan Petkov.
